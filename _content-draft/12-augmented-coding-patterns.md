## Core Concept: Emerging Patterns for Coding with Generative AI

### The Challenge

**Reality**: Coding with AI sometimes feels brilliant and sometimes frustrating

**Solution**: Map of patterns that make it more powerful and predictable
- From first experiments to advanced techniques

### Key Themes

**Dual Exploration**:
- **Inherent Limitations**: Explore the inherent limitations of Generative AI
- **New Possibilities**: Explore the new possibilities it creates

**Understanding**: Examine not just what happens, but why it happens

**Purpose**: Understanding these underlying dynamics equips you to:
- Adapt patterns in powerful ways
- Combine patterns effectively
- Come up with your own solutions

**Real-World Application**: Real-world examples show some of these combinations in action

### Learning Outcomes

**Techniques**: Leave with techniques that aren't tied to any single LLM or coding agent
- Practical approaches you can apply immediately

**Mental Models**: Mental models that keep you effective in this rapidly changing landscape

## Key Principles

### 1. Pattern-Based Approach

**Concept**: Map of patterns that make coding with AI more powerful and predictable

**Range**: From first experiments to advanced techniques

**Benefit**: Provides structured approach to understanding effective practices

### 2. Understanding Underlying Dynamics

**Principle**: Examine not just what happens, but why it happens

**Benefit**: Understanding underlying dynamics enables:
- Adapting patterns
- Combining patterns
- Creating your own solutions

### 3. Limitations and Possibilities

**Dual Focus**: Explore both:
- Inherent limitations of Generative AI
- New possibilities it creates

**Purpose**: Balanced understanding leads to realistic expectations and effective use

### 4. Adaptability

**Flexibility**: Techniques aren't tied to any single LLM or coding agent

**Benefit**: Approaches remain relevant as technology evolves

### 5. Mental Models

**Importance**: Mental models keep you effective in rapidly changing landscape

**Purpose**: Provide frameworks for thinking about AI-assisted coding
