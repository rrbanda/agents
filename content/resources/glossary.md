# AI Hub Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of AI and Agentic systems terminology.

---

## A

### Agent
An AI system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike simple AI assistants, agents can operate autonomously and use tools.

### Agentic AI
AI systems designed to act with a degree of autonomy, making decisions and taking actions to accomplish goals with minimal human intervention.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of protocols and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

---

## C

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
A prompting technique where the AI is encouraged to show its reasoning process step-by-step before arriving at an answer.

### Context Window
The maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that a language model can process at once.

### Context Engineering
The practice of carefully constructing the information provided to an AI system to optimize its outputs.

---

## F

### Fine-tuning
The process of further training a pre-trained model on a specific dataset to improve its performance on particular tasks.

### Foundation Model
A large AI model trained on broad data that can be adapted for various downstream tasks.

---

## G

### Generative AI
AI systems that can create new content (text, images, code, etc.) based on patterns learned from training data.

### Grounding
Connecting AI responses to real, verifiable information sources to reduce hallucinations.

---

## H

### Hallucination
When an AI generates content that appears plausible but is factually incorrect or made up.

---

## L

### Large Language Model (LLM)
A neural network trained on massive text datasets that can understand and generate human-like text.

### LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
A technique for efficiently fine-tuning large models by only training a small number of parameters.

---

## M

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
A standardized protocol for connecting AI systems with external tools and data sources.

### Multi-Agent System
A system where multiple AI agents work together, often with different specializations, to accomplish complex tasks.

---

## P

### Prompt
The input text provided to an AI model to generate a response.

### Prompt Engineering
The practice of designing and optimizing prompts to get desired outputs from AI models.

---

## R

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
A technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to provide more accurate and grounded responses.

### Reasoning
The ability of an AI to logically think through problems, often by breaking them into steps.

---

## T

### Token
The basic unit of text that language models process. A token can be a word, part of a word, or a character.

### Tool Use
The ability of an AI agent to interact with external tools, APIs, or systems to accomplish tasks.

---

## V

### Vector Database
A database optimized for storing and searching high-dimensional vectors, commonly used for semantic search in AI applications.
