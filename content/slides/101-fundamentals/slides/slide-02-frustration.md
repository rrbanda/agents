## Speaker Notes

**Narrative Approach**:
- Set the scene for each persona
- Build the frustration
- Use the quotes as emotional hooks
- Create connection with audience

**For SysAdmins:**
"Imagine Sarah, a RHEL sysadmin. Every morning - same routine. 2 hours analyzing logs from 50 servers. She's looking for anomalies, but most of it is noise. Then another hour documenting incidents. This is repetitive, time-consuming work. What if an agent could do the initial triage?"

**For DevOps:**
"Marcus, a DevOps engineer. 2am page. Deployment failed. He needs to trace through 15 microservices, check logs, metrics, and configs. There's no clear starting point. What if an agent could do the initial investigation?"

**For Developers:**
"Alex, a developer. Joins a new team. 200K line codebase. They need to understand how authentication works, but it's spread across 20 files. Where do you even start? What if an agent could guide them through it?"

**Delivery**:
- Read with pacing, build the frustration
- Pause before quotes
- Let quotes land emotionally
- "What if" creates anticipation

**Timing**: 2-3 minutes

**Interaction**: Ask audience to identify with one persona (raise hands)

**Tone**: Relatable, building frustration, creating anticipation
