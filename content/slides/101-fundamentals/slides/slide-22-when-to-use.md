# Slide 22: When to Use Agents

## Slide Content

### Decision Framework

**Use Agents When:**
- ✅ Task requires multiple steps
- ✅ Need to adapt to new information
- ✅ Can't predict exact path
- ✅ Value justifies cost

**Don't Use Agents When:**
- ❌ Simple, single-step task
- ❌ Fully predictable workflow
- ❌ Cost exceeds value
- ❌ Need deterministic results

**Key Question**: Does this need flexibility and adaptation?

## Speaker Notes

**Be Honest**:
- Agents aren't always the answer
- Sometimes simple automation is better
- Sometimes a script is enough
- Use agents when you need flexibility and adaptation

**Key Insight**: Not every problem needs an agent. Choose the right tool for the job.

**Timing**: 2-3 minutes
