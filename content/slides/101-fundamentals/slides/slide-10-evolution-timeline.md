## Speaker Notes

### Detailed Explanation

**Opening**: "Let's see the complete picture. Here's how we got here."

**Stage-by-Stage** (point to each on timeline):

**2017-2020: Language Models**
- "This is where it started"
- "Statistical prediction - given text, predict next token"
- "Single-turn responses - ask a question, get an answer"
- "Machines that talk - but they don't understand"

**2020-2022: Assistants**
- "Next step: context management"
- "Reactive helpers - they wait for prompts"
- "Multi-turn conversations - they remember the conversation"
- "Machines that remember - but still reactive"

**2022-2023: Reasoning**
- "The breakthrough: chain-of-thought"
- "Models could reason step-by-step"
- "Self-reflection - they could improve their answers"
- "Machines that think - actual reasoning emerged"

**2023-Present: Agents**
- "The convergence: memory + tools + goals"
- "Autonomous action - they pursue outcomes"
- "Machines that act - this is where we are now"

**The Progression**:
- "Each stage builds on the previous"
- "From reactive to proactive"
- "From answering to acting"
- "The journey: from answering questions to achieving goals"

**Key Insight**:
- "This wasn't planned - it emerged"
- "Each breakthrough opened new possibilities"
- "We're at the beginning of the agent era"

**Transition**: "Now let's understand what agents actually are."

**Timing**: 2 minutes
