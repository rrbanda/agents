Every morning - same routine. 2 hours analyzing logs from 50 servers. She's looking for anomalies, but most of it is noise. Then another hour documenting incidents. This is repetitive, time-consuming work. What if an agent could do the initial triage?\"\n\n**For DevOps:**\n\"Marcus, a DevOps engineer. 2am page. Deployment failed. He needs to trace through 15 microservices, check logs, metrics, and configs. There's no clear starting point. What if an agent could do the initial investigation?\"\n\n**For Developers:**\n\"Alex, a developer. Joins a new team. 200K line codebase. They need to understand how authentication works, but it's spread across 20 files. Where do you even start? What if an agent could guide them through it?\"\n\n**Delivery**:\n- Read with pacing, build the frustration\n- Pause before quotes\n- Let quotes land emotionally\n- \"What if\" creates anticipation\n\n**Timing**: 2-3 minutes\n\n**Interaction**: Ask audience to identify with one persona (raise hands)\n\n**Tone**: Relatable, building frustration, creating anticipation",

What do I need to know?\"\n   - \"This is the foundation for everything else\"\n\n2. **Take Action**\n   - \"Based on what it gathered, it takes action\"\n   - \"Makes a change, calls a tool, writes code\"\n   - \"This is where it actually does something\"\n\n3. **Verify Work**\n   - \"Did it work? Did it succeed?\"\n   - \"Checks the result, tests the output\"\n   - \"This is how it knows if it's on track\"\n\n4. **Repeat**\n   - \"And it does it again\"\n   - \"Gathers more context, takes next action, verifies\"\n   - \"This is how it makes progress\"\n\n**The Universal Application** (point to examples):\n- \"This isn't just for agents - this is how ALL technical work happens\"\n- \"SysAdmins: Gather logs, analyze, verify fixes\"\n- \"DevOps: Gather metrics, deploy, verify deployment\"\n- \"Developers: Gather code context, write code, verify tests\"\n- \"Same pattern. Different tools. Universal principle.\"\n\n**Key Insight**: \n- \"This is how humans work too\"\n- \"We gather info, take action, verify results\"\n- \"Agents just do it faster and more consistently\"\n\n**Real-World Connection**:\n- \"Think about debugging a problem\"\n- \"You gather logs (Gather Context)\"\n- \"You try a fix (Take Action)\"\n- \"You check if it worked (Verify Work)\"\n- \"And you repeat until it's fixed\"\n- \"Agents do the same thing\"\n\n**Transition**: \"Now let's see how this applies to your specific work.\"\n\n**Timing**: 3-4 minutes\n\n**References**: See Content 4, Section \"The Agent Loop Pattern\"",
