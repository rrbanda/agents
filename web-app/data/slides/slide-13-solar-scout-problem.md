## Speaker Notes

**Narrative Approach**:

**Key Points**:
- Real-world problem many companies face
- Time-consuming, repetitive work
- Different teams need different information
- The question creates anticipation

**Delivery**:
- Read the routine with pacing (each line a beat)
- Pause before "The Cost"
- "The Question" - create suspense

**Timing**: 1-2 minutes

**Tone**: Storytelling, building to reveal
