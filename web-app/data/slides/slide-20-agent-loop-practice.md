# Slide 20: The Agent Loop in Practice

## Slide Content

### How Each Phase Works

**Gather Context:**
- SysAdmin: Read logs, check metrics
- DevOps: Read pipeline logs, check configs
- Developer: Read code, check documentation

**Take Action:**
- SysAdmin: Analyze, suggest fixes
- DevOps: Debug, deploy
- Developer: Explain, write code

**Verify Work:**
- SysAdmin: Check if fixes work
- DevOps: Verify deployment
- Developer: Run tests, check understanding

**Same pattern, different tools.**
