# Slide 5: The Cold Open

## Slide Content

### The AI Evolution

**Ten years ago**, machines learned to see.

**Five years ago**, they learned to speak.

**In the past two years** — they learned to *reason in language*.

We used them to finish our sentences, refactor our code, and summarize the internet.

**But so far, they've only ever *reacted*.**

They wait for a prompt — and then respond.

**What happens when a model doesn't just *answer*, but *acts*?**

**When software stops being a tool and starts behaving like a teammate?**
