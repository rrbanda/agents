### The First Breakthrough

**2017-2020: Language Models Emerge**

Given "Dogs are …," they predict the next token.

Through trillions of examples, they gain *fluency*.

But not *understanding*.

---

**What We Discovered:**
- They speak beautifully
- They can generate human-like text
- But they don't know what they're saying

**The Reality**: Statistical prediction, not reasoning.

**The Limit**: Machines that talk — but cannot think.

---

## Speaker Notes

**Narrative Approach**: 
- Tell the story of discovery
- Show the excitement of what was possible
- Reveal the limitation

**Key Points**:
- This was revolutionary at the time
- But we quickly saw the limits
- They could talk, but not think
- This created the need for what came next

**Example**: "If I say 'Dogs are', the model predicts what comes next based on patterns it's seen, not because it understands dogs."

**Timing**: 2 minutes

**Tone**: Reflective, building toward the next revelation

## Visual Description

**Visual**: Cinematic reveal style:
- Timeline: "2017-2020" subtly shown
- Large text: "Language Models Emerge"
- Discovery points listed
- The limitation revealed at bottom

**Design**: 
- Dark, cinematic background
- Text appears progressively (if animated)
- "The Limit" section visually distinct
- Professional but visually engaging
