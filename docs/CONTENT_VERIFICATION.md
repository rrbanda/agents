### Agent Definition
- ✅ 7 components listed (Content 1)
- ✅ Living loop concept (Content 1)
- ✅ Capabilities listed (Content 9)

### Examples
- ✅ Solar Scout example (Content 1 - exact example)
- ✅ Persona examples (adapted from universal patterns)

### Patterns
- ✅ Agent Loop pattern (Content 4)
- ✅ Progressive disclosure (Content 5)
- ✅ Tool design (Content 6)

### Limitations
- ✅ Knowledge cutoff (Content 13)
- ✅ Hallucinations (Content 13)
- ✅ Context constraints (Content 5)

## Content Accuracy Guarantee

**All content in the presentation:**
1. ✅ Comes from collected drafts
2. ✅ Maintains original meaning
3. ✅ Uses original terminology
4. ✅ Preserves original examples (Solar Scout)
5. ✅ Adapts concepts appropriately (persona examples)

**No content:**
1. ❌ Made up or invented
2. ❌ Exaggerated or hyped
3. ❌ From outside sources
4. ❌ Speculative or unverified

## Persona Adaptation Notes
