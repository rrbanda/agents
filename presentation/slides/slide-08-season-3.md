### The Moment Everything Changed

**2022-2023: A Discovery**

We asked models to "think step by step."

Something unexpected happened.

---

**Chain-of-thought reasoning emerged.**

Add self-reflection: "Review and improve your last answer."

The model began to plan, verify, and correct itself.

---

**For the first time, language became thought.**

Not just prediction — actual reasoning.

**This was the spark.**

---
